        <p>Hello my name is Bryce Debernarde and this webpage is basically about me and the projects that i have done. 
        I grew up in a family of five children with me being the third child which put me smack dab in the middle of our extremely chaotic group of kids.
        I grew up in good ol California, or when it used to be good ol California to me and before you even have the thought of the question:
        yes I did surf a little bit. I started participating in sports when I was in first grade starting off with jiu jitsu then moving on to football 
        which I played for fifteen to sixteen years or somewhere around there. I honestly do not remember a time I was not playing football when it was 
        football season.Besides my love for football I have also loved listening to music and playing video games. They have always been a way for me to
        entertain myself while my parents were worrying about how to not have us cause complete and utter chaos around the house. Reading has probably been 
        one of my favorite things to do as a child besides playing sports. As a child I would for hours on end which is something I still do to this day. 
        Reading is one of the things that lets me experience someone else’s story that they have either lived or created and lets me enjoy it as if I were  
        living it. But enough about me if you wish to look at projects that i have worked on they should be right below under the “My Projects” title. </p>
